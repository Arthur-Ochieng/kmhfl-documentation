# Welcome to KMHFL

The KMHFL (Kenya Master Health Facility List) is an application with all the health facilities and community units within the country. They are represented with a distinct code that contains specific details of their geo location, administrative location, services offered, and the ownership of the respective unit.

Within KMHFL, you will be able to come across:
Facilities - This provides a list of all the health facilities available in the nation. There is a much tailored research button where you can refine your search to find the exact facility that you are looking for.

Community Units - Here, you find a list of all the community units registered in the system. You can also refine your search using administrative units.

GIS Explorer - This visualizes administrative units (counties, constituencies, wards) and their facilities and Community Health Units. Users can also rate Facilities and Community Health Units.

KMHFL API - This provides a RESTful API for developers to use. The documentation is available at https://mfl-api-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest

## Reports 

In the new version of the system, there are two types of reports generated, i.e static reports and dynamic reports. Both reports are accessible from `Reports` on the main navigation bar. The links opens up a dropdown which lets you select either of the two reports.

### Dynamic Reports
### Static Reports

To view all available categories of reports, a logged in user should click the Reports link on the main navigation bar. This opens up a view with a s idebar listing possible reports user can view. An example is facility owners report, clicked from the sidebar shows a grid listing names of different categories of facility owners and the number of facilities each owns respectively. For most of the other reports a user simply selects the link from the sidebar and views the report with an option of Exporting the report in Excel format.

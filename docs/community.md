## Creating Community Units

The process of creating a new community unit is quite similar to that of facilities. However, community units are much easier as there are not as much entries. Click on the `Add Community Heakth Unit` button on the page. This redirects you to a new page with three levels of entry.

### 1) Basic Details

This section contains the **basic (primary)** details of a CHU. It includes a workers extension where you enter the name of the desired units, number of volunteers and the number of household served by the unit

Once the process is complete, you click on the save button below on the page and the entries of the new unit are saved in the system. The created unit should appear on the community unit list screen.


## Updating Community Unit Details

Updating details of a community unit requires you to navigate to the specific unit. From there you click on the `Edit`button to update the details.

You could also search for the unit from the search bar. The process is same to that of creating a unit, with the same levels available for editing

## Approved and Rejected Community Units

 One can reject or approve a facility depending on its current status. This is through the reject/approve button which redirects you to the next page to give a reason for the action.
